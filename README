App Engine 911 Site
Looking for volunteers interested in building an appengine 911 site. The idea is simply this: 

A user in distress calls the centre. 
The call operator picks up the call and logs the details including 'geolocation'. 
The system figures out all policemen close to the caller and fires a text to them.

To my mind the components will essentially be:
a simple screen for logging in calls WITH locations
a maps page showing two layers
	* layer one shows distress areas
	* layer two shows locations of police officers
a backend code that figures out officers close to the distress areas and sends them an sms


Most of the code will be in appengine python, however GWT would be helpful for the UI and javascript would be helpful for the maps layering and any AJAX stuff.


Any volunteers ?
